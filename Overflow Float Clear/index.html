        The CSS overflow property specifies how to handle the content when it
        overflows its block level container. We know that every single element
        on a page is a rectangular box and the size, positioning and behavior of
        these boxes are controlled via CSS. Let's take an example: If you don't
        set the height of the box, it will grow as large as the content. But if
        you set a specific height or width of the box and the content inside
        cannot fit then what will happen. The CSS overflow property is used to
        overcome this problem. It specifies whether to clip content, render
        scroll bars, or just display content.

      <p class="p2">
        The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add
        scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the
        specified area. The overflow property has the following values: visible
        - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the
        element's box hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the
        content will be invisible scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a
        scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content auto - Similar to
        scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary Note: The overflow
        property only works for block elements with a specified height. Note: In
        OS X Lion (on Mac), scrollbars are hidden by default and only shown when
        being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).
